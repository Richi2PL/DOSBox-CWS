# DOS emulator

DOSBox emulates an Intel x86 PC, complete with sound, graphics, mouse, joystick, etc.,
necessary for running many old MS-DOS games that simply cannot be run on modern PCs and operating systems,
such as Google(TM) Chrome OS, Chrome OS Flex. 
However, it is not restricted to running only games. 
In theory, any MS-DOS or PC-DOS (referred to commonly as "DOS") application should run in DOSBox,
but the emphasis has been on getting DOS games to run smoothly.
DOSBox also comes with its own DOS-like command prompt. 
It is still quite rudimentary and lacks many of the features found in MS-DOS,
but it is sufficient for installing and running most DOS games.
